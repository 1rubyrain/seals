# seals!!!
## minecraft beta 1.7.3 mod that adds baby harp seals as a passive mob

# [download](https://github.com/1rubyrain/seals/releases)

i made this for fun but feel free to open any issues and i will see if i can help

## features
- 1/500 chance for a seal to spawn with a top hat (won't despawn)

## options
- 1/5 chance to drop sponges on death (off by default)
- using black wool gives seals hats (off by default, undermines the rarity of them)
- i had to fix a bug relating to entities being pushable, thought i'd make the fix an option in case it's incompatible with other mods

## planned features
- wiktor said make the seal squish when you land on it
- random hat colour / dyeable hats
