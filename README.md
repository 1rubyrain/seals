minecraft beta 1.7.3 babric mod that adds baby harp seals as a passive mob
### [downloads](https://github.com/1rubyrain/seals/releases)

## features
- naturally spawning on beaches & in snowy areas
- 1/500 chance for a seal to spawn with a top hat (won't despawn unless configured otherwise)
- tickle a seal's nose with a feather to make it sneeze (small explosion, drops 1 slime ball)
- landing on a seal will make you bounce back up if not crouching (similar to slime blocks)

## options
- 1/5 chance to drop sponges on death (off by default)
- allow seals with hats to despawn (off by default)
- using black wool gives seals hats (off by default, undermines the rarity of them)
- i had to fix a bug relating to entities being pushable, thought i'd make the fix optional in case it's incompatible with other mods (on by default)
